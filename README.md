# CodePath 

### The folders in this repository contain the projects I completed for the [CodePath.org](https://codepath.org/) Online Android Course. 

They include the following Android Apps:

- [x] A TODO APP -

- [x] A Flixter app that displays the latest movie releases.

- [x] A Twitter clone that calls the [Twitter REST API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public) to display the users real Twitter Feed.
