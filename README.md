# CodePath 

### The folders in this repository contain the projects I completed for the [CodePath.org](https://codepath.org/) Online Android Course. 

They include the following Android Apps:

- [x] A Simple Todo app that allows users to build a todo list and basic todo items management functionality including adding new items, editing and deleting an existing item.-

- [x] A Flixter app that allows users to browse movies from the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#). 

- [x] A Twitter clone that calls the [Twitter REST API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public) to display the users real Twitter Feed. 

- [x] A photo sharing app similar to Instagram but using Parse as its backend.
